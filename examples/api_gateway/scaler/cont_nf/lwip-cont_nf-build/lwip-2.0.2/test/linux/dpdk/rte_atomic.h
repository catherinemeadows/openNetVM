/** @name Coherent I/O Memory Barrier
 *
 * Coherent I/O memory barrier is a lightweight version of I/O memory
 * barriers which are system-wide data synchronization barriers. This
 * is for only coherent memory domain between lcore and I/O device but
 * it is same as the I/O memory barriers in most of architectures.
 * However, some architecture provides even lighter barriers which are
 * somewhere in between I/O memory barriers and SMP memory barriers.
 * For example, in case of ARMv8, DMB(data memory barrier) instruction
 * can have different shareability domains - inner-shareable and
 * outer-shareable. And inner-shareable DMB fits for SMP memory
 * barriers and outer-shareable DMB for coherent I/O memory barriers,
 * which acts on coherent memory.
 *
 * In most cases, I/O memory barriers are safer but if operations are
 * on coherent memory instead of incoherent MMIO region of a device,
 * then coherent I/O memory barriers can be used and this could bring
 * performance gain depending on architectures.
